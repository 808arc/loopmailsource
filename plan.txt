6/12 20:10 I left last night my code to parse ig but it stuck with an error so im thinking maybe il should implement couldown
for scrasping fucntion or maybe it will be better if i just increase the time sleep. however im gonna try rn to run code from 
terminal just after i add input for artist name and input for song number 


6/11 20:18 I update code. Now it generate tabs and avoid missed link error so I consider its slighty stable. 

What I want to do is to append way how to reccord data in DB or sheet.

I need to implement option to deduplicate return of producer names and producer ig in list.
How to deduplicate data appendence to list?

Damn to deduplicate I must use set() but I will do this I need rewrite a b c d list titles omg im gonna ask
chatgpt to make this insrad of me





public_email method work 
but i need also get data from bio via info method 

how to do this? 
I need to create a different .py files with methods 
but how? 





!restructure the code 
(100%)add deduplication of producers 
(50%)add colums with tracks they produced 
add colums for email search from ig 

think about idea, add IG lurking module
improve timeout of genius API





code for ig link return: 

artist = genius.search_artist("Drake", max_songs=1)
artist_info = genius.artist(artist.id)
instagram_username = artist_info["artist"]["instagram_name"]
print(instagram_username)





add protection of api keys 


make return IG page by the name of producer 
- should I use scrapy? should I use another shit? find way how to make it with api call? ask another budy?

!potential solution: Actually, the WebAPI already provides their Twitter and Instagram username. Try this:

genius = lyricsgenius.PublicAPI(sleep_time=2)
artist = genius.artist(264329)["artist"]
print(artist["instagram_name"])


WTF IS WebAPI??? and how he get this artist id????



gitignore this file 
set up correclty api key insert via .txt file 


try to find way how to get ig id by name of producer
